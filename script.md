Have you ever wished you could vote for who you really wanted instead of the lessor of two evils?
Do you find it frustrating when others won't vote for a better candidate because they feel it would be throwing their vote away?
What if I can demonstrate a system of sound voting rights that fixes these problems?

Have a look at this ballot.
Here is your secret confirmation number.
It is randomly generated, known only by you, and used by you alone for this election only.
And here is where you can express your preferences completely,
instead of being limited to only your first choice.
In this case, the first place vote is for Minor Improvements,
the second place vote is for Status Quo
and the third and last place vote is for Radical changes.
So to be precise about what you are expressing here in this example,
you are saying you prefer Minor Improvements over Status Quo,
you prefer Minor Improvements over Radical Changes,
and finally, you prefer Status Quo over Radical Changes.
If you were only able to express your first choice,
the information that you prefer Status Quo over Radical Changes would be thrown away,
diminishing your voting rights.  
Now lets look at the public tally of this election,
but before we go there,
remember your confirmation number starts with D0, and ends with 8A.

Now that we are on the tally page, let's find your confirmation number.
Here it is among all the other ballots, the third one down.
Every single ballot is available to the public,
but since your confirmation number is private,
no one knows which one is yours.
You can verify right here that your ballot was counted accurately without sacrificing the secrecy of your ballot.
As you can see, just like the ballot you cast,
the first place is Minor Improvements,
the second place is Status Quo,
and the third and last place is Radical Changes.

The results are calculated by comparing every possible pairing of candidates.
From there we can find a total ordering of candidates.
With three candidates, as we have here, there are three possible pairings.
Minor Improvements vs. Status Quo.
Minor Improvements vs. Radical Changes.
and Status Quo vs Radical Changes.
Starting with Minor Improvements vs. Status Quo,
let's see how each of the 10 voters in this example choose.
The first three votes put Minor Improvements at first place and Status Quo at second place,
so that is 3 votes for Minor Improvements so far.
The next three votes put Status Quo at first place and Minor Improvements at second place,
so we add three votes to Status Quo.
So far, we have a 3-3 tie.
Finally, the last 4 votes rank Minor Improvements at second place and Status Quo at third place.
This gives us 4 more votes for Minor Improvements, making the score 7 to 3 in favor of Minor Improvements.
Notice that on these last 4 votes neither Minor Improvements nor Status Quo were in the first place position,
so this information would have been lost if we were only allowed to specify our first place preference.
So from this, we know that Minor Improvements must be ranked Higher than Status Quo,
as 7 people prefer Minor Improvements while only 3 people prefer Status Quo.
Our second pairing is Minor Improvements vs. Radical Changes, lets count the votes for this pairing.
The first 3 votes rank Minor Improvements at first place and Radical Changes at third place,
so that is three votes for Minor Improvements, 3-0 so far.
The next three votes rank Minor Improvements at second place and Radical Changes at third place,
so three more votes for Minor Improvements, 6-0 so far.
Also remember again, that since neither of these are a first place vote,
this information would have been lost if we were only allowed to specify our first choice.
Finally, the last 4 votes rank Radical Changes at first place and Minor Improvements at second place,
so that is 4 votes for radical changes,
bringing the total to 6-4.
So from this, we know that Minor Improvements must be ranked higher than Radical Changes,
as 6 people prefer Minor Improvements while only 4 people prefer Radical Changes.
Our last pairing is Status Quo vs. Radical changes,
and we compute this paring the same way we did with the first 2 pairings.
The first 3 votes rank Status Quo at second place and Radical Changes at third place,
so that is three votes for Status Quo, 3-0 so far.
The next three votes rank Status Quo at first place and Radical Changes at third place,
so three more votes for Status Quo, 6-0 so far.
Finally, the last 4 votes rank Radical Changes at first place and Status Quo at third place,
so that is 4 votes for radical changes,
bringing the total to 6-4.
So from this, we know that Status Quo must be ranked higher than Radical Changes,

Now that we have compared each candidate to each other candidate,
we are ready to figure out the total ordering.
Since Minor Improvements defeated Status Quo 7 to 3,
and also defeated Radical Changes 6 to 4,
we know Minor Improvements must be in first place.
Since Status Quo defeated Radical Changes 6 to 4,
we know Status must be in second place.
Finally, since Radical Changes did not defeat any other candidate,
Radical Changes goes into third and last place.

As obvious as it is that Minor Improvements is the best choice and Radical Changes is the worst choice given these votes,
the exact opposite would have happened if we only counted the highest first place votes instead of comparing all of the candidates to each other.
Although 6/10 voters preferred either Minor Improvements or Status Quo over Radical Changes,
their first place votes were split into 3 and 3 instead of 6, allowing Radical Changes to have the higher number at 4.
The voters for Status Quo would have been punished for voting honestly,
they would have been better off surrendering their votes to Minor Improvements in order to prevent Radical Changes from winning.
Only valuing first place votes makes it so that candidates don't need to listen to their voters,
all they have to do is frighten people into voting for them by demonizing their strongest opponent.
However, if we have a sound voting system that takes the entirety of voter preferences into account,
candidates have to listen to the people or risk being defeated by a third party candidate.

As all ballots are public by confirmation number rather than voter identification,
you can tally the votes yourself to ensure they were counted correctly,
while still maintaining the secrecy of your ballot.

At the bottom of this example there is a list of everyone who voted,
so that if you did not vote, your vote can not be stolen without your name showing up on this list.
Votes can not be diluted either because the number of names must match the number of ballots.

This example relies on having a small list of known individuals,
but there is no reason, in principle or in practice, that this can't be scaled to large countries,
by changing the details of how voter privacy and vote auditability are balanced.
The primary thing you have to get right is to make sure the number of registered voters matches the number of confirmation numbers,
and that the confirmation numbers are shuffled before being mailed out so that only the voter knows their confirmation number.

There are also ways to deal with unusual situations,
such as ending up with a circular preference,
that I have not gone over here.

So to summarize, here are 7 voting rights secured by this sound voting system.
- You have the right to personally verify that your vote was cast or not according to your choice
- You have the right to personally verify that your vote is accurate
- You have the right to personally verify that your vote was tallied correctly
- You have the right to be free from coercion in how you vote  This right is secured by implementing secret ballot
- Limited only by the constraints necessarily imposed by secret ballot, you have the right to be maximally assured that your vote was not diluted by illegitimate votes
- You have the right to have your complete preferences taken into account, by ranking all choices in your preferred order
- You have the right to vote honestly, without having to choose the lessor of two evils for fear your honest vote will work against you  This right is secured by implementing the condorcet criterion
